# Data Directory

This directory contains the datasets used for the Smart Ambulance project.

## Datasets

### 1. `smart_ambulance_synthetic_data.csv`
This dataset contains simulated continuous monitoring data for patients during ambulance transport. It includes columns such as `timestamp`, `heart_rate`, `spo2`, `sbp` (Systolic Blood Pressure), `dbp` (Diastolic Blood Pressure), `patient_type` (e.g., normal, critical, deteriorating), and `vibration` (to simulate ambulance motion noise).

**How it was created:**
The synthetic data generation involves baseline human vitals for different categories of patients:
- **Normal:** Healthy baselines (e.g., HR 60-90, SpO2 95-100%).
- **Stable:** Slightly elevated but steady vitals.
- **Deteriorating:** Vitals worsening over time (e.g., dropping SpO2, rising HR).
- **Critical:** Severe abnormal vitals indicating an emergency.

A simulation script (initially from `Safemobility.ipynb` or similar scripts) assigns these baselines and then applies scenarios reflecting the ambulance's environment:
- **Urban / Highway / Rural motions:** These introduce varying levels of artificial noise and `vibration` factors, dynamically altering the sensor readings' reliability and values.

### 2. `smart_ambulance_risk_scored_dl.csv`
This is an processed version of the synthetic dataset. It is generated by running `src/anomaly.py` on the `smart_ambulance_synthetic_data.csv`.
It includes the original features, plus engineered rolling statistics (like `hr_mean`, `spo2_trend`), deep learning reconstruction errors (for anomaly detection), clinical risk scores, confidence scores based on vibration, and the final `triage_status` labels (e.g., "NORMAL", "WARNING", "CRITICAL ALERT").

### 3. `human_vital_signs_dataset_2024.csv` and `Patient_vitals.csv`
These appear to be other raw datasets containing various real or synthesized patient vitals for reference or separate training tasks.
